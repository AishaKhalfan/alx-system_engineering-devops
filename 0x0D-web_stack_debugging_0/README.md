## Docker
### Readme
[What is Docker and why is it popular?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-docker-and-why-is-it-so-darn-popular/)
Let’s first pull a Docker image and run a container:

```
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker run -d -ti ubuntu:16.04

vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$
```
Note that docker command will pull the Ubuntu docker container image from the Internet and run it. I let you look at the meaning of the flags using the command docker run --help, the main idea is that it keeps the container up and running.

To execute a command on the Docker container, use docker exec:

```
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker exec -i e1fc0d4bbb5d hostname
e1fc0d4bbb5d
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ hostname
ubuntu-xenial
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$
```
If you want to connect to your Docker container and use Bash, you need to use docker exec -ti:
```
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker exec -ti e1fc0d4bbb5d /bin/bash
root@e1fc0d4bbb5d:/# echo "I am in $(hostname) Docker container"
I am in e1fc0d4bbb5d Docker container
root@e1fc0d4bbb5d:/# exit
exit
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$
```

If you want to stop a container, use docker stop:
```
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker stop e1fc0d4bbb5d
e1fc0d4bbb5d
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

# Web stack debugging
### Intro
Debugging usually takes a big chunk of a software engineer’s time. The art of debugging is tough and it takes years, even decades to master, and that is why seasoned software engineers are the best at it… experience. They have seen lots of broken code, buggy systems, weird edge cases and race conditions.

## Non-exhaustive guide to debugging
### School specific
If you are struggling to get something right that is run on the checker, like a Bash script or a piece of code, keep in mind that you can simulate the flow by starting a Docker container with the distribution that is specified in the requirements and by running your code. Check the Docker concept page for more info.

### Test and verify your assumptions
The idea is to ask a set of questions until you find the issue. For example, if you installed a web server and it isn’t serving a page when browsing the IP, here are some questions you can ask yourself to start debugging:

- Is the web server started? - You can check using the service manager, also double check by checking process list.
- On what port should it listen? - Check your web server configuration
- Is it actually listening on this port? - ```netstat``` -```lpdn``` - run as root or sudo so that you can see the process for each listening port
- It is listening on the correct server IP? - ```netstat``` is also your friend here
- Is there a firewall enabled?
- Have you looked at logs? - usually in ```/var/log``` and ```tail -f``` is your friend
- Can I connect to the HTTP port from the location I am browsing from? - ```curl``` is your friend
There is a good chance that at this point you will already have found part of the issue.

## Get a quick overview of the machine state

[Youtube video First 5 Commands When I Connect on a Linux Server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_gqlbADaAw)

When you connect to a server/machine/computer/container you want to understand what’s happened recently and what’s happening now, and you can do this with [5 commands](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/first-5-commands-when-i-connect-linux-server/) in a minute or less:

```w```
- shows server [uptime](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/uptime-and-downtime) which is the time during which the server has been continuously running
- shows which users are connected to the server
- load average will give you a good sense of the server health - (read more about load here and here)

```history```
- shows which commands were previously run by the user you are currently connected to
- you can learn a lot about what type of work was previously performed on the machine, and what could have gone wrong with it
- where you might want to start your debugging work

```top``
- shows what is currently running on this server
- order results by CPU, memory utilization and catch the ones that are resource intensive

```df```
- shows disk utilization

```netstat```
- what port and IP your server is listening on
- what processes are using sockets
- try ```netstat -lpn``` on a Ubuntu machine

### Machine
Debugging is pretty much about verifying assumptions, in a perfect world the software or system we are working on would be working perfectly, the server is in perfect shape and everybody is happy. But actually, it NEVER goes this way, things ALWAYS fail (it’s tremendous!).

For the machine level, you want to ask yourself these questions:

- Does the server have free disk space? - ```df```
- Is the server able to keep up with CPU load? - ```w, top, ps```
- Does the server have available memory? ```free```
- Are the server disk(s) able to keep up with read/write IO? - ```htop```
If the answer is no for any of these questions, then that might be the reason why things are not going as expected. There are often 3 ways of solving the issue:

- free up resources (stop process(es) or reduce their resource consumption)
- increase the machine resources (adding memory, CPU, disk space…)
- distributing the resource usage to other machines


### Network issue

For the machine level, you want to ask yourself these questions:

- Does the server have the expected network interfaces and IPs up and running? ```ifconfig```
- Does the server listen on the sockets that it is supposed to? netstat (netstat -```lpd or netstat -lpn)```
- Can you connect from the location you want to connect from, to the socket you want to connect to? telnet to the IP + PORT (telnet 8.8.8.8 80)
- Does the server have the correct firewall rules? ```iptables```, ```ufw:```
	- ```iptables -L```
	- ```sudo ufw status```

### Process issue

If a piece of Software isn’t behaving as expected, it can obviously be because of above reasons… but the good news is that there is more to look into (there is ALWAYS more to look into actually).

- Is the software started? init, init.d:
```service NAME_OF_THE_SERVICE status```
```/etc/init.d/NAME_OF_THE_SERVICE status```
- Is the software process running? pgrep, ps:
```pgrep -lf NAME_OF_THE_PROCESS```
```ps auxf```
-Is there anything interesting in the logs? look for log files in /var/log/ and tail -f is your friend

### Debugging is fun

Debugging can be frustrating, but it will definitely be part of your job, it requires experience and methodology to become good at it. The good news is that bugs are never going away, and the more experienced you become, trickier bugs will be assigned to you! Good luck :)

## Background Context
The Webstack debugging series will train you in the art of debugging. Computers and software rarely work the way we want (that’s the “fun” part of the job!).

Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master of it.

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given to you, the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. But before writing this Bash script, you should figure out what is going on and fix it manually.

Let’s start with a very simple example. My server must:

- have a copy of the ```/etc/passwd file in /tmp```
- have a file named ```/tmp/isworking``` containing the string OK

Let’s pretend that without these 2 elements, my web application cannot work.

Let’s go through this example and fix the server.

```
vagrant@vagrant:~$ docker run -d -ti ubuntu:14.04
Unable to find image 'ubuntu:14.04' locally

vagrant@vagrant:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
76f44c0da25e        ubuntu:14.04        "/bin/bash"         13 seconds ago      Up 12 seconds                           infallible_bhabha
vagrant@vagrant:~$ docker exec -ti 76f44c0da25e /bin/bash
root@76f44c0da25e:/# ls /tmp/
root@76f44c0da25e:/# cp /etc/passwd /tmp/
root@76f44c0da25e:/# echo OK > /tmp/isworking
root@76f44c0da25e:/# ls /tmp/
isworking  passwd
root@76f44c0da25e:/#
vagrant@vagrant:~$
```
Then my answer file would contain:
```
aisha@ubuntu:~$ cat answerfile
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Fix my server with these magic 2 lines
cp /etc/passwd /tmp/
echo OK > /tmp/isworking
aisha@ubuntu:~$
```
Note that as you cannot use interactive software such as emacs or vi in your Bash script, everything needs to be done from the command line (including file edition).

## Installing Docker
For this project you will be given a container which you can use to solve the task. If you would like to have Docker so that you can experiment with it and/or solve this problem locally, you can install it on your machine, your Ubuntu 14.04 VM, or your Ubuntu 16.04 VM if you upgraded.

- [Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
- [Ubuntu 14.04 (Note that Docker for Ubuntu 14 is deprecated and you will have to make some adjustments to the instructions when installing)](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-install-docker-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts/)
- [Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04)

```curl```

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- Your Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck without any error
- Your Bash scripts must run without error
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/env bash```
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

# TASKS

## Tasks 0. Give me a page!

Be sure to read the Docker concept page

In this first debugging project, you will need to get Apache to run on the container and to return a page containing ```Hello Holberton``` whenquerying the root of it.

Example:
```
vagrant@vagrant:~$ docker run -p 8080:80 -d -it holbertonschool/265-0
47ca3994a4910bbc29d1d8925b1c70e1bdd799f5442040365a7cb9a0db218021
vagrant@vagrant:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
47ca3994a491        holbertonschool/265-0   "/bin/bash"         3 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   vigilant_tesla
vagrant@vagrant:~$ curl 0:8080
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
vagrant@vagrant:~$
```
Here we can see that after starting my Docker container, I ```curl``` the port ```8080``` mapped to the Docker container port 80, it does not return a page but an error message. Note that you might also get the error message ```curl: (52) Empty``` reply from server.
```
vagrant@vagrant:~$ curl 0:8080
Hello Holberton
vagrant@vagrant:~$
```
After connecting to the container and fixing whatever needed to be fixed (here is your mission), you can see that curling port 80 return a page that contains ```Hello Holberton```. Paste the command(s) you used to fix the issue in your answer file.
