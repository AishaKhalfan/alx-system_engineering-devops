# 0x0C-web_server

## Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

[What is a Child Process?](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Processes.html#Processes)

##What is a Child Process?
- Although it may sound like something out of a parenting handbook or a psychological journal, the term child process actually has nothing to do with human development. If you run a Unix or Linux dedicated server, you have likely encountered child processes without even knowing it. Therefore, it is good to know what child processes are and how they work.

- A child process is a process created by another process. The creator process is properly called the “parent process”. The benefit of a child process is that it can start or stop at will without affecting the parent process. The child process is, however, is typically dependent on the parent process. If the parent process dies, the child process becomes an orphan process.

- In normal server operations, the kernel may initiate child processes, and other programs, such as Apache, may have them as well. Apache creates child processes (or children, if you prefer) whenever the number of requests (web page accesses from users) exceeds the maximum allowed number of requests. When the maximum number of child process requests is exceeded, another child process spawns.

- To view all running processes along with their child processes in a “tree” format, use the following command:

```$ ps axf```

In this project, some of the tasks will be graded on 2 aspects:

1. Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements
2. Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)

- For example, if I need to create a file ```/tmp/test``` containing the string hello world and modify the configuration of Nginx to listen on port 8080 instead of 80, I can use emacs on my server to create the file and to modify the Nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default.

But my answer file would contain:
```
aisha@ubuntu cat 88-script_example
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Configuring a server with specification XYZ
echo hello world > /tmp/test
sed -i 's/80/8080/g' /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
aisha@ubuntu
```

# TASKS
## Task 0. Transfer a file to your server

Write a Bash script that transfers a file from our client to a server:

Requirements:

-  Accepts 4 parameters
	1. The path to the file to be transferred
	2. The IP of the server we want to transfer the file to
	3. The username ```scp``` connects with
	4. The path to the SSH private key that scp uses
- Display ```Usage: 0-transfer_file PATH_TO_FILE IP USERNAME PATH_TO_SSH_KEY``` if less than 3 parameters passed
- scp must transfer the file to the user home directory ```~/```
- Strict host key checking must be disabled when using ```scp```
Example:

```
aisha@ubuntu$ ./0-transfer_file
Usage: 0-transfer_file PATH_TO_FILE IP USERNAME PATH_TO_SSH_KEY
aisha@ubuntu$
aisha@ubuntu$ ssh ubuntu@8.8.8.8 -i /vagrant/sylvain 'ls ~/'
afile
aisha@ubuntu$ 
aisha@ubuntu$ touch some_page.html
aisha@ubuntu$ ./0-transfer_file some_page.html 8.8.8.8 sylvain /vagrant/private_key
some_page.html                                     100%   12     0.1KB/s   00:00
aisha@ubuntu$ ssh ubuntu@8.8.8.8 -i /vagrant/private_key 'ls ~/'
afile
some_page.html
aisha@ubuntu$
```
In this example, I:

- remotely execute the ```ls ~/``` command via ```ssh``` to see what ```~/``` contains
- create a file named ```some_page.html```
- execute my ```0-transfer_file``` script
- remotely execute the ```ls ~/``` command via ```ssh``` to see that the file ```some_page.html``` has been successfully transferred
That is one way of publishing your website pages to your server.

## Task 1. Install nginx web server
Readme:

- [-y on apt-get command](https://askubuntu.com/questions/672892/what-does-y-mean-in-apt-get-y-install-command)
Web servers are the piece of software generating and serving HTML pages, let’s install one!

Requirements:

- Install ```nginx``` on your ```web-01```
- server
- Nginx should be listening on port 80
- When querying Nginx at its root ```/``` with a GET request (requesting a page) using ```curl```, it must return a page that contains the string ```Hello World!```
- As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
- You can’t use ```systemctl``` for restarting ```nginx```
Server terminal:
```
root@sy-web-01$ ./1-install_nginx_web_server > /dev/null 2>&1
root@sy-web-01$ 
root@sy-web-01$ curl localhost
Hello World!
root@sy-web-01$ 
```
Local terminal:

```
aisha@ubuntu$ curl 34.198.248.145/
Hello World!
aisha@ubuntu$ curl -sI 34.198.248.145/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Tue, 21 Feb 2023 23:43:22 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 30
Last-Modified: Tue, 21 Feb 2023 07:21:32 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "58abea7c-1e"
Accept-Ranges: bytes

aisha@ubuntu$
```
In this example ```34.198.248.145``` is the IP of my ```web-01 server```. If you want to query the Nginx that is locally installed on your server, you can use curl ```127.0.0.1```.

If things are not going as expected, make sure to check out Nginx logs, they can be found in ```/var/log/```.

## Task 2. Setup a domain name

- [.TECH Domains](https://get.tech/) is one of the top domain providers. They are known for the stability and quality of their DNS hosting solution. We partnered with .TECH Domains so that you can learn about DNS.

- .TECH Domains worked with domain name registrars to give you access to a free domain name for a year. Please get the promo code in your tools space. Feel free to drop a thank you tweet for .TECH Domains.

Provide the domain name in your answer file.

Requirement:

- provide the domain name only (example: ```foobar.tech```), no subdomain (example:```www.foobar.tech```)
- configure your DNS records with an A entry so that your root domain points to your web-01 IP address Warning: the propagation of your records can take time (~1-2 hours)
- go to your profile and enter your domain in the Project website url field
Example:
```
aisha@ubuntu$ cat 2-setup_a_domain_name
myschool.tech
aisha@ubuntu$
aisha@ubuntu$ dig myschool.tech

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> myschool.tech

aisha@ubuntu$
```
- When your domain name is setup, please verify the Registrar here: ```https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com/``` and you must see in the JSON response: "registrarName": "Dotserve Inc"

## Task 3. Redirection
Readme:

- [Replace a line with multiple lines with sed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26041088/sed-replace-line-with-multiline-variable)
Configure your Nginx server so that /redirect_me is redirecting to another page.

Requirements:

- The redirection must be a “301 Moved Permanently”
- You answer file should be a Bash script containing commands to automatically configure a Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
- Using what you did with ```1-install_nginx_web_server```, write ```3-redirection``` so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
Example:
```
aisha@ubuntu$ curl -sI 34.198.248.145/redirect_me/
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Tue, 21 Feb 2023 21:36:04 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 193
Connection: keep-alive
Location: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4

aisha@ubuntu$
```
## Task 4. Not found page 404
Configure your Nginx server to have a custom 404 page that contains the string Ceci n'est pas une page.

Requirements:

- The page must return an HTTP 404 error code
- The page must contain the string Ceci n'est pas une page
- Using what you did with 3-redirection, write 4-not_found_page_404 so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
Example:
```
aisha@ubuntu$ curl -sI 34.198.248.145/xyz
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:46:43 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 26
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "58acb50e-1a"

aisha@ubuntu$ curl 34.198.248.145/xyzfoo
Ceci n'est pas une page

aisha@ubuntu$
```

## Task 5. Install Nginx web server (w/ Puppet)
Time to practice configuring your server with Puppet! Just as you did before, we’d like you to install and configure an Nginx server using Puppet instead of Bash. To save time and effort, you should also include resources in your manifest to perform a 301 redirect when querying /redirect_me.

Requirements:

- Nginx should be listening on port 80
- When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
- The redirection must be a “301 Moved Permanently”
- Your answer file should be a Puppet manifest containing commands to automatically configure an Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
