# 0x10. HTTPS SSL

## Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

##  DNS
DNS is, in simple words, the technology that translates human-adapted, text-based domain names to machine-adapted, numerical-based IP:

- [Learn everything about DNS in cartoo]n(https://howdns.works/)
- Be sure to know the main DNS record types:
	- A
	- CNAME
	- MX
	- TXT

## Advanced
- [Use DNS to scale with round-robin DNS](https://www.dnsknowledge.com/whatis/round-robin-dns/)
- [What’s an NS Record?](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ns-record/)
- [What’s an SOA Record?](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/soa-record/)

### The root domain and sub domain - differences
A root domain is the parent domain to a sub domain, and its name is not, and can not be divided by a dot.

While creating any domain at a website of domain provider, the provider system will always ask you to choose a domain name without a dot in the name. In other words, the address of the root domain may be mydomain.com but it can never be my.domain.com. Domain providers block the ability to create such a root domain until you type a name without the dot. Why?

The dot in the domain name delimits the sub domain name (the part of the name before the dot, eg. www.my.) and the root domain name ( the part after the dot, ie .domain.com). This means that the address my.domain.com is a sub domain of the root domain, whose name is domain.com

In an administrator panel at domain provider account, you can create any number of sub domains. This means that for the root domain called domain.com it is possible to create different sub domains eg. my.domain.com, your.domain.com, school.domain.com… Creating multiple sub domains is always free and does not require you to set up new accounts on a domain provider website.

As you can see, all of the domain addresses used as an example (above) do not start with the www prefix. www is also a sub domain. The www prefix always leads to the main domain. See: What’s the point in having www in a url?

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- What is HTTPS SSL 2 main roles
- What is the purpose encrypting traffic
- What SSL termination means

# Tasks
## Task 0. World wide web
Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain www points to your load-balancer IP (lb-01). Let’s also add other subdomains to make our life easier, and write a Bash script that will display information about subdomains.

Requirements:

- Add the subdomain www to your domain, point it to your lb-01 IP (your domain name might be configured with default subdomains, feel free to remove them)
- Add the subdomain lb-01 to your domain, point it to your lb-01 IP
- Add the subdomain web-01 to your domain, point it to your web-01 IP
- Add the subdomain web-02 to your domain, point it to your web-02 IP
- Your Bash script must accept 2 arguments:
   1. domain:
	- type: string
	- what: domain name to audit
	- mandatory: yes
   2. subdomain:
	- type: string
	- what: specific subdomain to audit
	- mandatory: no
- Output: The subdomain [SUB_DOMAIN] is a [RECORD_TYPE] record and points to [DESTINATION]
- When only the parameter domain is provided, display information for its subdomains www, lb-01, web-01 and web-02 - in this specific order
- When passing domain and subdomain parameters, display information for the specified subdomain
- Ignore shellcheck case SC2086
- Must use:
	- awk
	- at least one Bash function
- You do not need to handle edge cases such as:
	- Empty parameters
	- Nonexistent domain names
	- Nonexistent subdomains
Example:

```
aisha@ubuntu$ dig www.holberton.online | grep -A1 'ANSWER SECTION:'
;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.holberton.online.   87  IN  A   54.210.47.110
aisha@ubuntu$ dig lb-01.holberton.online | grep -A1 'ANSWER SECTION:'
;; ANSWER SECTION:
lb-01.holberton.online. 101 IN  A   54.210.47.110
aisha@ubuntu$ dig web-01.holberton.online | grep -A1 'ANSWER SECTION:'
;; ANSWER SECTION:
web-01.holberton.online. 212    IN  A   34.198.248.145
aisha@ubuntu$ dig web-02.holberton.online | grep -A1 'ANSWER SECTION:'
;; ANSWER SECTION:
web-02.holberton.online. 298    IN  A   54.89.38.100
aisha@ubuntu$
aisha@ubuntu$
aisha@ubuntu$ ./0-world_wide_web holberton.online
The subdomain www is a A record and points to 54.210.47.110
The subdomain lb-01 is a A record and points to 54.210.47.110
The subdomain web-01 is a A record and points to 34.198.248.145
The subdomain web-02 is a A record and points to 54.89.38.100
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-world_wide_web holberton.online web-02
The subdomain web-02 is a A record and points to 54.89.38.100
aisha@ubuntu$
```

   
## Task 1. HAproxy SSL termination

“Terminating SSL on HAproxy” means that HAproxy is configured to handle encrypted traffic, unencrypt it and pass it on to its destination.

Create a certificate using ```certbot``` and configure HAproxy to accept encrypted traffic for your subdomain www..

Requirements:

- HAproxy must be listening on port TCP 443
- HAproxy must be accepting SSL traffic
- HAproxy must serve encrypted traffic that will return the / of your web server
- When querying the root of your domain name, the page returned must contain Holberton School
- Share your HAproxy config as an answer file (/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg)
The file ```1-haproxy_ssl_termination``` must be your HAproxy configuration file

Make sure to install HAproxy 1.5 or higher, [SSL termination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy) is not available before v1.5.

Example:
```
aisha@ubuntu$ curl -sI https://www.holberton.online
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Tue, 28 Feb 2023 01:52:04 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 30

X-Served-By: 03-web-01
Accept-Ranges: bytes
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl https://www.holberton.online
Holberton School for the win!
aisha@ubuntu$
```
   
## Task 2. No loophole in your website traffic
A good habit is to enforce HTTPS traffic so that no unencrypted traffic is possible. Configure HAproxy to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

Requirements:

This should be transparent to the user
- HAproxy should return a ```301```
- HAproxy should redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS
- Share your HAproxy config as an answer file (/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg)
The file ```100-redirect_http_to_https``` must be your HAproxy configuration file

Example:
```
aisha@ubuntu$ curl -sIL http://www.holberton.online
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Content-length: 0
Location: https://www.holberton.online/
Connection: close

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Tue, 28 Feb 2023 02:19:18 GMT
